This folder contains solutions to some problems of "Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition" in MS Word files. I wrote the solutions initially in Google Docs and then converted the files to MS Word.

In many coding interviews the first interview is via video conferencing, and you have to write your solution into a Google Docs file (or some other text editor). So, it's good to practice writing solutions with Google Docs.
